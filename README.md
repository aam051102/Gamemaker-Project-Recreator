# Gamemaker-Recompiler
This is a Gamemaker: Studio recompiler, I'm building it based on data by WarlockD's Underdecomp, this means that you'll have to download
and use that first.

To use this, simply download the exe file, then put it in the same folder as the Underdecomp exe.
You'll then need to double run the exe and then it's pretty much straight forward from there.
The only feature done, at the moment, is sprite conversion.
