# Gamemaker-Recompiler
This is a Gamemaker: Studio project recompiler, I'm building it based on data by WarlockD's GMDSam ( Underdecomp ), this means that you'll have to download and use that first.

Link: https://github.com/WarlockD/GMdsam

To use this, simply download the exe file, then put it in the same folder as the Underdecomp exe.
You'll then need to double run the exe and then it's pretty much straight forward from there.
All features are available, some code and id's may be problematic, this will be fixed soon.

If the program doesn't respond, no worries, it's just working, if any errors come up, restart it.

Thank you to Colinator27 for helping me out with this project.

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MAY NEED TO CONFIGURE A FEW THINGS IN GAMEMAKER STUDIO ITSELF.
